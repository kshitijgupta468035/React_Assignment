# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Some asked quiestion

## Q How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Most of the things are already mentioned in the assignment so for the technical I have used react that helps me to create the user interface more dynamic. React works on jsx format that means we can use javascript and html both in the same file and that helps to do things easily as compared to old methods and I have also use basic css beacuse advances css framewaork usage is not allowed in the assignment. For the architecture, I have used single-page web app architectire and I have used this approach because in this website design approach new page content is not served from loading new HTML pages but generated dynamically through JavaScript's ability to manipulate the DOM elements on the existing page itself. 

## Q Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes, I will make the user interface more attractive and create more sub-sections for movies and series section. I will add the home, about, signup, etc button in the navbar of the homepage.


## Q What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
If I have more time to do this assignment then I will add more sections as in this assignment we have movies and series section only but I would like to create sub-sections of movies and series that will help to filter movies and series more precisely. I will also add thegoogle login button and signup button in the navbar section and I will also add movie reviews and ratings with each and every movie.
